# SVG Map script

Use an SVG image and coordinates to create a scalable, clickable image map.

Requires [jQuery](http://jquery.org) and [snap.svg](http://snapsvg.io)

This is using a PNG embedded in the SVG map as the creates a smaller file size. It would be equally possible to use a true SVG map as well.

There are two versions of this script:

    * Using a 'standard' set of MAP coordinates in the HTML file itself
    * Using an external SVG file with a set of PATH sections to describe the clickable areas.

The code is pretty straightforward and simple. This is my first SVG work so I may have taken the wrong approach to the dealing with SVG, in which case I welcome improvements.
